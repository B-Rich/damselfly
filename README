damselfly is a utility which allows one to use Dragon
NaturallySpeaking to provide input to X11 (under Linux)

damselfly consists of 2 Python scripts, one which acts as a server and
the other which acts as a client. the server runs on the Linux side
and does the work of interacting with the windowing system . the
client runs on the wine side and and handles command recognition and
dispatching of commands to the server . the client and server
communicate via a pair of named pipes.

basic installation and setup instructions can be found in the file
named INSTALL.

damselfly implements a superset of the functionality provided by the
dragonfly package.  damselfly does not override any of the classes
provided by dragonfly, however it implements X aware equivalents where
necessary.  therefore I am only documenting the differences between
dragonfly and damselfly in this file. please also read the
documentation for dragonfly found at
http://pythonhosted.org/dragonfly/

the following are the new classes implemented by damselfly :

class XKey:
this class functions the same as the Key class from dragonfly, except
that a meta modifier has been added. Also the Windows key is mapped to
the super key.  so the mapping for the modifier keys is:

    'a' : 'alt'
    'c' : 'ctrl'
    's' : 'shift'
    'w' : 'super'
    'm' : 'meta' 

class XText:
this class functions the same as the Text class does in dragonfly 

the Paste class from dragonfly has no equivalent in damselfly 

class XMouse:
this class functions the same as the Mouse class does in dragonfly,
except that it also implements the mouse wheel buttons . so that gives
us 5 different mouse buttons which we can click or press: 'left' ,
'middle' , 'right' , 'wheel up' , and 'wheel down'

classes WaitXWindow, BringXApp, StartXApp, FocusXWindow are used in
the same way as their non-X dragonfly equivalents
